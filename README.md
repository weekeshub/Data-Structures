# Data-Structures
Homework projects from my undergraduate data structures course

Projects 1, 2, and 4 are all about building an efficient sorting framework and analyzing the results of running the algorithms. 
  - Analysis consists of looking at the number of comparisons and exchanges that each algorithm must perform to sort the data.
  - Each version of the framework was tested with 6 data sets:
      - 3 sets with numbers 1-16: one already sorted, one randomly sorted, and one reverse sorted.
      - 3 sets with numbers 1-2000: one already sorted, one randomly sorted, and one reverse sorted.
Project 3 is a program that converts a mathematical expression from infix form to postfix form.

More about 1, 2, and 4:
Project 1 includes three basic sorting algorithms: bubble, selection, and insertion sort. 
Project 2 is an extension of project 1 that adds shell sort and merge sort to the framework.
Project 4 excludes the three basic sorting algorithms but includes shell sort and merge sort from project 2. It adds heap sort to the framework.
